# agonlight-code-library
A collection of useful subroutines

I'm a novice BBC BASIC programmer!  These programs may or may not be the best methods, but work for me.

(No warranty, your mileage may vary, yada, yada, yada.)



JOYTEST.BAS
Console8 compatible joystick code in BBC BASIC.

SIMPLE-SPRITE-DEMO.BAS  (and sprites .rgb files.)
A very simplified sprite demo.  
Sprites created with Sprite Editor (https://github.com/robogeek42/agon_basic_mycode)

LANDERx.BAS
This is a project where I'm learning BBC BASIC by doing.  A simple Lunar Lander Game which requires a Console8 compatible joystick.  The file requires the lander rgb sprites to work correctly.  I'll leave older version of LANDERx.BAS as the program moves forward.
