GLASSTTY is a simple Viewdata client written in BBC BASIC to connect
to the GLASSTTY.COM TELSTAR System.

Requirements: 
    
  *  An AgonLight with a MOD-WIFI-ESP32 loaded with Zimodem Firmware.
   
  *  The GLASSTTY.BAS client.

Information on the GLASSTTY TELSTAR Viewdata System can be found at:
https://glasstty.com/telstar

While the Zimodem firmware must be set at 9600 baud, the service
itself streams at a realistic 2400 baud, providing the BASIC client
plenty of time to keep up with the connection.

GLASSTTY also provides a gateway connection to several other
compatible online services.  (Option 6 once connection.)

GLASSTTY.BAS supports most Viewdata commands and graphics, 
except double-height text.
